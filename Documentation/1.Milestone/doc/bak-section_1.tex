		It seems that the processors are only about 40 percent busy while executing the program.
		In general this might be caused by the following facts:
		    
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item thread synchronization bottleneck (lock/unlock)
			\item thread overhead; too many threads started in parallel until the threads exceed available data to process
			\item too many sequential code parts
			\item too less RAM, which results to too high amount of data flow between the registers and the memory
    \end{itemize}
